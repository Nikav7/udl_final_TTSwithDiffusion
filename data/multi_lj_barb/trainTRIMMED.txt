ab-02.wav|Grande storia, ma lasciamo perdere. E in ogni caso questa sera scherziamo un po' come avete capito dal nostro titolo ma non del tutto, non del tutto.|0
ab-03.wav|C'è un fondo.|0
ab-04.wav|di verità in questa analogia che vi propongo.|0
ab-05.wav|Perché insomma.|0
ab-06.wav|immaginiamo che io adesso mi metta a parlarvi di una grande multinazionale.|0
ab-07.wav|una grande organizzazione conosciuta in tutto il mondo.|0
ab-08.wav|con sedi in tutti i Paesi.|0
ab-09.wav|Fondata grazie.|0
ab-10.wav|allo slancio visionario di un giovane fondatore carismatico.|0
ab-11.wav|che è diventato un mito già da vivo.|0
ab-12.wav|e ancor di più dopo la morte.|0
ab-13.wav|Un'organizzazione riconoscibile anche dal punto di vista visivo per le sue scelte di comunicazione. Per il look inconfondibile,|0
ab-14.wav|che la caratterizza.|0
ab-15.wav|Sto parlando della Apple e di Steve Jobs.|0
ab-16.wav|Naturalmente no, sto parlando di San Francesco e dell'Ordine francescano.|0
ab-17.wav|Le analogie fra gli ordini religiosi.|0
ab-18.wav|del Medioevo perché io sono specialista di Medioevo e quelli li conosco meglio. Ma il discorso potrebbe essere prolungato anche agli ordini religiosi dell'età moderna e fino ad oggi.|0
ab-19.wav|le analogie con le grandi aziende odierne.|0
ab-20.wav|sono così vistose.|0
ab-21.wav|tanto nel funzionamento nell'organizzazione.|0
ab-22.wav|quanto proprio nelle comunicazioni.|0
ab-23.wav|Che vien da chiedersi se se le strategie e il linguaggio delle multinazionali non si siano ispirati consapevolmente,,|0
ab-24.wav|a quell'esperienza.|0
ab-25.wav|Poi vien da chiedersi e uno si dice no, figuriamoci se sono ispirati consapevolmente. Però allora le analogie sono ancora più curiose.,|0
ab-26.wav|Vi leggo un breve brano.|0
ab-27.wav|che ho tirato giù da un sito di marketing.|0
ab-28.wav|comunicazione.|0
ab-29.wav|e management.|0
ab-30.wav|E vediamo se identificate in questo brevissimo testo.|0
ab-31.wav|quelle parole che anche travestite nel gergo anglofono del business internazionale in realtà vengono dritte dal mondo dei monaci medievali.,,|0
ab-32.wav|La creazione di un'azienda di successo.|0
ab-33.wav|passa per l'attenta concezione di una vision.|0
ab-34.wav|E per il perseguimento della sua mission.|0
ab-35.wav|Quando la vision è fissata con cura dall'imprenditore, essa viene trasmessa con semplicità al resto dei dipendenti che la assimilano più facilmente identificandosi con gli scopi dell'azienda.|0
ab-36.wav|La mission è la fase successiva grazie ad esse eccetera eccetera. Ora è inglese o è business english non si sa bene che lingua sia. Però,,|0
ab-37.wav|lo vedete da soli che visione.|0
ab-38.wav|e missione sono parole che vengono dritte dal mondo dei frati e dei monaci.|0
ab-39.wav|E oggi non c'è documento di marketing o manuale di comunicazione aziendale che queste parole non le impieghi a ogni riga.|0
ab-40.wav|E d'altra parte perché le grandi aziende non dovrebbero ispirarsi al modello degli ordini religiosi medievali?.|0
ab-41.wav|E un modello di tale successo!.|0
ab-42.wav|Gli ordini religiosi medievali.|0
ab-43.wav|Nascono tutte come start up.|0
ab-44.wav|vengono tutti fondati a un certo momento dal nulla.|0
ab-45.wav|e hanno dei tassi di crescita.|0
ab-46.wav|che farebbero invidia a chiunque.|0
ab-47.wav|Dieci anni dopo che Francesco d'Assisi ha avuto l'intuizione di fondare il suo ordine.|0
ab-48.wav|i francescani erano già alcune migliaia.|0
ab-49.wav|Il che vuol dire che erano quasi raddoppiati ogni anno.|0
ab-50.wav|Per l'esattezza è stato calcolato un tasso di crescita dell'80 per 100 annuo.|0
ab-51.wav|Ovviamente i frati.|0
ab-52.wav|aderiscono all'ordine e vengono mantenuti perché l'ordine guadagna tramite donazioni a sufficienza per mantenerli quindi questa è vera crescita. Più sono i frati più evidentemente l'ordine sta ricevendo finanziamenti.|0
ab-53.wav|Anche la conquista di nuovi mercati viene gestita dagli ordini religiosi.|0
ab-54.wav|in modo scientifico manageriale.|0
ab-55.wav|con campagne mirate di espansione.|0
ab-56.wav|Resto sui francescani che offrono molti buoni esempi. I francescani nascono in Italia centrale.|0
ab-57.wav|Per un po' si diffondono in Umbria Lazio.|0
ab-58.wav|poi cominciano a decidere di espandersi all'estero.|0
ab-59.wav|In Lombardia.|0
ab-60.wav|E in Germania.|0
ab-61.wav|E mandano delle missioni per l'appunto dei gruppi di predicatori specialmente preparati selezionati fra quelli che sanno predicare nelle lingue straniere in Lombardico.|0
ab-62.wav|ed in teutonico.|0
ab-63.wav|E un paese dopo l'altro viene conquistato. Nel 1219 Francesco decide di mandare un gruppo di frati in Francia.,,|0
ab-64.wav|Finora.|0
ab-65.wav|non c'erano ancora i francescani lì.|0
ab-66.wav|Vent'anni dopo in Francia ci sono già qualcosa come 72 conventi.|0
ab-67.wav|Questi tassi enormi di crescita.|0
ab-68.wav|creano anche dei problemi naturalmente.|0
ab-69.wav|In primo luogo proprio Francesco.|0
ab-70.wav|Francesco a un certo punto ha aperto gli occhi e si è accorto di aver creato un mostro.|0
ab-71.wav|Era a capo di una multinazionale.|0
ab-72.wav|Lui che voleva andare in giro scalzo con quattro amici.|0
ab-73.wav|a parlare di Gesù alla gente e mantenersi scaricando cassette al mercato.|0
ab-74.wav|perché quello era il progetto originario.|0
ab-75.wav|Una cosa non notissima ma ne riparleremo. Vedremo perché non è notissima. é che Francesco negli ultimi anni di vita è allibito di quello che è successo al suo progetto.|0
ab-76.wav|Per un bel po' l'ha voluto lui.|0
ab-77.wav|Poi di colpo si è accorto di cosa stava succedendo. Francesco negli ultimi anni di vita si dimette dalla direzione dell'Ordine francescano in polemica con quello che i francescani sono diventati.|0
ab-78.wav|E creando dei grossissimi problemi all'ordine.|0
ab-79.wav|Perché per l'immagine dell'organizzazione.|0
ab-80.wav|e per la motivazione dei membri è importantissima tanto nelle grandi aziende di oggi quanto negli ordini religiosi. Per tutte queste cose,,|0
ab-81.wav|il mito del fondatore.|0
ab-82.wav|è essenziale.|0
ab-83.wav|Ecco un altro aspetto che accomuna tante grandi aziende con molti ordini religiosi medievali e non solo.|0
ab-84.wav|Se voi ci pensate nel ventesimo secolo e poi oggi.|0
ab-85.wav|i grandi fondatori di aziende gli Henry Ford i Bill Gates gli Steve Jobs.|0
ab-86.wav|sono stati mitizzati in vita.|0
ab-87.wav|e poi sono diventati delle leggende.|0
ab-88.wav|Introducendo una cosa che non sembra ma ha anch'essa delle precise origini medievali quella cosa mirabolante che è la biografia autorizzata.|0
ab-89.wav|Sapete cos'è la biografia autorizzata nel caso di un personaggio pubblico di un grande imprenditore.|0
ab-90.wav|è la compagnia stessa o gli eredi che affidano a un autore il compito di scrivere la biografia.|0
ab-91.wav|e gli dicono cosa può scrivere e cosa non può scrivere e gli forniscono i documenti che vogliono loro.|0
ab-92.wav|Ora questa non è nient'altro che la versione.|0
ab-93.wav|moderna.|0
ab-94.wav|dell'agiografia medievale.|0
ab-95.wav|L'agiografia medievale consisteva nello scrivere la vita di un grande personaggio. Se penso ai fondatori di ordini gli esempi ve li darò subito.|0
ab-96.wav|ovviamente dicendo le cose che bisognava dire e tacendo le altre.|0
ab-97.wav|Oggi poi naturalmente si scoprono gli altarini. Se voi andate a cercare su internet il mito di Henry Ford o il mito di Steve Jobs è tutta la corsa a tirar fuori le cose che non sono state dette.|0
ab-98.wav|Henry Ford era antisemita era nazista. Ma nelle grandi biografie autorizzate naturalmente questo non si dice.|0
ab-99.wav|San Francesco è un esempio straordinario di come consapevolmente una grande organizzazione.|0
ab-100.wav|costruisce il mito del suo fondatore.|0
ab-101.wav|Francesco era appena morto.|0
ab-102.wav|e l'Ordine francescano stabilisce di scrivere una biografia autorizzata ante litteram l'espressione non c'è ma è quello.|0
ab-103.wav|Viene individuato un frate che conosceva bene Francesco Tommaso da Celano.|0
ab-104.wav|e gli si dice Adesso tu scrivi la biografia di Francesco.|0
ab-105.wav|Tommaso da Celano si mette al lavoro.|0
ab-106.wav|Scrive.|0
ab-107.wav|Quella che verrà poi conosciuta come la vita prima.|0
ab-108.wav|di San Francesco. Lui non lo sapeva che era la prima mentre la scriveva.|0
ab-109.wav|pensava che fosse la sua vita di San Francesco.|0
ab-110.wav|e Tommaso da Celano racconta tante cose di San Francesco che la gente si ricorda.|0
ab-111.wav|Racconta che San Francesco era un personaggio scomodo.|0
ab-112.wav|Che i genitori erano una famiglia che pensava solo ai soldi per niente religiosi.|0
ab-113.wav|Che lui da giovane pensava alla carriera al successo. Voleva diventare un cavaliere.|0
ab-114.wav|E poi anche dopo quando ha avuto la vocazione e ha creato i francescani, Tommaso da Celano racconta che Francesco è rimasto sempre un personaggio scomodo.|0
ab-115.wav|Racconta tanti aneddoti.|0
ab-116.wav|che quando i capi dell'ordine leggono.|0
ab-117.wav|si mettono le mani nei capelli cioè nella tonsura e si dicono ma.|0
ab-118.wav|è il caso?.|0
ab-119.wav|di scriverle queste cose?.|0
ab-120.wav|Quella volta che Francesco era con un gruppetto di frati ed è arrivata una vecchietta che era la mamma di uno di loro a chiedere un po' di aiuto, un po' di carità.|0
ab-121.wav|E Francsco ha detto: abbiamo qualcosa da dare alla nostra mamma?.|0
ab-122.wav|perché dice tommaso, lui chiamava sempre la nostra mamma tutte le mamme di tutti i frati. E i frati gli dicono naturalmente no, non abbiamo niente siamo poveri.|0
ab-123.wav|Dice Franceso non abbiamo proprio niente niente?.|0
ab-125.wav|guardati intorno l'unico oggetto che c'è qui è il vangelo che usiamo per dir messa.|0
ab-126.wav|e Francesco dice.|0
ab-127.wav|ma vendiamolo!.|0
ab-128.wav|Vendiamolo il vangelo e aiutiamo la nostra mamma ed Dio sarà molto più contento se facciamo così che non di vederci che usiamo il vangelo per cantare messa.|0
ab-129.wav|Ecco.|0
ab-130.wav|i capi dei francescani cominciano ad alzare un sopracciglio.|0
ab-131.wav|poi si va avanti a leggere quel che racconta tommaso da celano, ne racconta tante cose tommaso da celano.|0
ab-132.wav|quella volta che san francesco si èmesso a predicare agli uccelli.|0
ab-133.wav|I capi dell'ordine francescano dicono: speriamo che stavolta gli uccellini sono inoffensivi no!.|0
ab-134.wav|San Francesco si è messo predicare agli uccelli perché era andato a Roma.|0
ab-135.wav|a parlare in pubblico e i romani non hanno voluto starlo a sentire.|0
ab-136.wav|Perché Roma è una città del vizio e della corruzione. La città meno cristiana che ci sia e quindi francesco ha detto: non volete starmi a sentire? io me ne vado allora piuttosto. Esce, va alla discarica. Alla discarica comunale ci sono tutti gli uccellacci che svolazzano sulle discariche e san francesco si mette a predicare a loro.|0
ab-137.wav|E poi francesco non era perfetto sbagliava e si arrabbiava, perdeva la pazienza.|0
ab-138.wav|E queste cose tommaso da celano le racconta.|0
ab-139.wav|Quella volta che c'era un frate che faceva assistenza ai lebbrosi.|0
ab-140.wav|Nella loro casa perché i lebbrosi hanno la loro casetta però ci devono stare chiusi dentro.|0
ab-141.wav|E invece il frate aveva fatto amicizia con uno di questi lebbrosi e lo portava sempre fuori a messa insieme a lui, e francesco gli diceva lascia perdere non portarlo questo arriva piagato sanguinante gocciolante alla gente.|0
ab-142.wav|L'altro non la capisce e una bella volta francesco si arrabbia lo manda al diavol gli ordina di riportarsi via il lebbroso e di non farlo più vedere.|0
ab-143.wav|poi si pente.|0
ab-144.wav|Si rende conto di quel che ha fatto.|0
ab-145.wav|E allora ha bisogno di fare penitenza.|0
ab-146.wav|E va alla casa dei lebbrosi e si siede a tavola con loro e mangia con loro. Ora naturalmente sapete come funziona nel medioevo si mangia sempre su una tovaglia di bucato, guai a non averla! però però poi si pesca con le dita dal piatto comune.|0
ab-147.wav|E i lebbrosi con le loro dita sanguinanti e piene di piaghe pescano e francesco pesca.|0
ab-148.wav|E dice tommaso da celano: e gli altri frati stavano a guardare molto addolorati e incerti su cosa dovevano pensare.|0
ab-149.wav|I capi dell'ordine francescano dicono a tommaso: ma francesco non era così!.|0
ab-150.wav|francesco era grande francesco non sbagliava mai!.|0
ab-151.wav|toglile un po' di queste cose.|0
ab-152.wav|E francesco e tommaso da celano scrive la vita seconda.|0
ab-153.wav|In cui risulta che i genitori di francesco erano molto religiosi e pii.|0
ab-154.wav|E che francesco fin da bambino aveva la vocazione religiosa e così via, e così via.|0
ab-155.wav|Però i leader dell'ordine francescano gli dicono: tommaso, però non hai mica parlato abbastanza dei miracoli.|0
ab-156.wav|Francesco è un grande santo ha fatto tanti miracoli, scrivi!.|0
ab-157.wav|E tommaso da celano scrive una terza vita di san francesco dove ci mette tutti i miracoli, e però nell'introduzione dice,|0
ab-158.wav|più o meno adesso basta non possono pretendere che io dica che il quadro e tondo.|0
ab-159.wav|e quindi certi di quei racconti scomodi li lascia.|0
ab-160.wav|Finché un po di anni dopo il generale dell'ordine francescano, san bonaventura.|0
ab-161.wav|Decide che effettivamente non va bene. L'immagine di francesco non può essere affidata a questi testi, bisogna scriverne un'altra biografia quella veramente autorizzata, definitiva.|0
ab-162.wav|Bonaventura scrive la legenda maior.|0
ab-163.wav|In cui tutte le cose sgradevoli sono sparite, Francesco non ha mai un dubbio.|0
ab-164.wav|Francesco non esita mai, non sbaglia mai è sempre serafico e sorridente e soprattutto è inimitabile è un altro cristo.|0
ab-165.wav|è inutile che i francescani stiano a dire dovremmo stare scalzi come lui no no è impossibile ormai l'ordine non più tanta voglia di estremismi.|0
ab-166.wav|E bonaventura da all'ordine quello che serve in quel momento per motivare i membri. Francesco era un altro cristo non è che possiamo imitarlo, noi poveri uomini. Dopodiché.|0
ab-167.wav|Bonaventura manda una circolare a tutti i conventi francescani.|0
ab-168.wav|Dicendo: adesso voi andate in biblioteca.|0
ab-169.wav|Prendete tutte le vite di san francesco che avete e le bruciate.|0
ab-170.wav|E io vi manderò.|0
ab-171.wav|quella definitiva in sostituzione.|0
ab-172.wav|E per secoli nessuno ha saputo niente delle vite scritte da tommaso da celano e da altri.|0
ab-173.wav|poi tra otto e novecento in qualche monastero benedettino.|0
ab-174.wav|dove delle circolari dei francescani se ne infischiavano sono stati ritrovati singoli esemplari di queste vite e si è visto che la immagine di francesco che avevamo era tutta diversa da quella da quella che si credeva, che che era in realtà insomma!.|0
ab-175.wav|L'ho fatta lunga perché è un esempio straordinario questo di come nel medioevo si può costruire e stravolgere la biografia di un grande personaggio in questo caso il fondatore di un ordine.|0
ab-176.wav|per dei motivi precisi all'ordine serve che l'immagine sia quella e non un'altra.|0
ab-177.wav|finché uno è vivo.|0
ab-178.wav|può dare un'impronta.|0
ab-179.wav|quando poi muore, non è detto che continui.|0
ab-180.wav|e certe volte anche da vivo non si riesce. Prima accennavo un possibile parallelo tra san francesco e steve jobs.|0
ab-181.wav|steve jobs.|0
ab-182.wav|ha questo per esempio in comune con san francesco: le idee chiarissime sull'importanza del look.|0
ab-183.wav|Questa organizzazione deve essere composta da persone riconoscibili all'aspetto.|0
ab-184.wav|forse non tutti sanno che.|0
ab-185.wav|tutti sanno naturalmente che steve jobs andavasempre in giro con un maglioncino nero a collo alto e jeans.|0
ab-186.wav|io non avevo mai fatto caso che dovessero essere jeans senza cintura.|0
ab-187.wav|ma la biografia autorizzata di steve jobs.|0
ab-188.wav|quella di isaacson di walter isaacson.ci svela che invece il look era proprio quello: jeans senza cintura e maglioncino nero.,|0
ab-189.wav|Quello che svela il biografo è che steve jobs.|0
ab-190.wav|che il biografo tanto per non perdere l'analogia, spesso chiama il visionario.|0
ab-191.wav|steve jobs fra le altre visioni che aveva per il futuro della apple.|0
ab-192.wav|ha tentato più volte di imporre a tutti i membri dell'or dell'azienda.|0
ab-193.wav|di portare lo stesso abbigliamento.|0
ab-194.wav|più volte ha cercato di convincerli che ogni dipendente della apple doveva avere lo stesso maglioncino nero e gli stessi jeans senza cintura.|0
ab-195.wav|poi.|0
ab-196.wav|non c'è mai riuscito.|0
ab-197.wav|a cupertino gli hanno sempre detto che loro volevano continuare a vestirsi come volevano loro jobs alla fine ha rinunciato però a quel punto ha deciso che lui almeno non avrebbe più ceduto.|0
ab-198.wav|e deliberatamente si è sempre vestito allo stesso modo non aveva altri abiti. Quando il biografo va a trovarlo.|0
ab-199.wav|job la biografia è stata scritta ha cominciato a scrivere quando era ancora vivo e jobs lo porta nel suo guardaroba dove ha un centinaio di maglioncini neri tutti uguali.|0
ab-200.wav|e gli dice questo è il mio abbigliamento.|0
