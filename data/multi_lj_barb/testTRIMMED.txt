ab-202.wav|previsione corretta fra l'altro.|0
ab-203.wav|Francesco invece è riuscito a imporre ai suoi frati di vestirsi tutti allo stesso modo.|0
ab-204.wav|finché era vivo.|0
ab-205.wav|perché sembra che i francescani si vestano sempre così.|0
ab-206.wav|in realtà francesco ai frati ha detto chiaramente: guardate come si vestono i poveri, guardate come si vestono i braccianti.|0
ab-207.wav|un saio di tela di sacco una corda alla vita perché non possono pagarsi una cintura di pelle è un cappuccio.|0
ab-208.wav|questo è un dettaglio che a noi moderni rischia di sfuggire l'occhio per i dettagli della moda. Loro invece lo vedevano al volo lo vedi come vestono i contadini? un cappuccio a punta.|0
ab-209.wav|è una cosa che piace ai poveri contadini i giovani snob di città come era francesco da giovane quindi lui lo sa bene ai giovani snob di città quel quei cappucci a punta non li metterebbero mai.|0
ab-210.wav|cappucci ampi arrotondati.|0
ab-211.wav|francesco impone il saio fatto di tela di sacco col cappuccio da contadino.|0
ab-212.wav|appena è morto.|0
ab-213.wav|cominciano a comparire i sai di stoffe più pregiate|0
ab-214.wav|comodi ben tagliati e il cappuccio.|0
ab-215.wav|si arrotonda.|0
ab-216.wav|si amplia diventa un cappuccio alla moda come lo portano i giovanotti eleganti non più il cappuccio a punta da contadini.|0
ab-217.wav|sembra una cosa da niente ma gli storici dell'arte.|0
ab-218.wav|con le tecnologie di cui dispongono oggi hanno visto che in diverse tavole.|0
ab-219.wav|dipinte dell'epoca in cui era raffigurato san francesco,,|0
ab-220.wav|a un certo punto è stato fatto un piccolo intervento hanno cancellato il cappuccio a punta.|0
ab-221.wav|e gli hanno rimesso il cappuccio bello arrotondato alla moda.|0
ab-222.wav|dopodiché gruppetti di frati francescani continuano a ricordarsi che non era quella l'idea di francesco vanno avanti secoli con questa minoranza che litiga fino a quando la minoranza non decide di uscire e di fondare, come sapete l'ordine dei cappuccini.|0
ab-223.wav|che si chiamano così esclusivamente per via della valenza simbolica che loro percepivano in questo in questo cappuccio.|0
ab-224.wav|ora questa faccenda.|0
ab-225.wav|dell'abito uguale per tutti.|0
ab-226.wav|non è soltanto come poteva pensare francesco di imporre come dire ai frati di essere veramente umili.|0
ab-227.wav|di essere veramente uguali agli ultimi.|0
ab-228.wav|ma c'è anche un'altra cosa che anche francesco sicuramente sapeva.|0
ab-229.wav|che bisogna essere riconoscibili.|0
ab-230.wav|per gli ordini religiosi del medioevo la riconoscibilità è un elemento fondamentale del successo perché sono in concorrenza fra loro.,,|0
ab-231.wav|tanto per fare un esempio.|0
ab-232.wav|c'è una fase in cui tra i monaci benedettini il monastero di cluny è particolarmente autorevole conosciuto, molti altri monasteri.|0
ab-233.wav|si sottomettono all'abate di cluny, gli chiedono mandaci uno dei tuoi per insegnarci come si fa è una specie di franchising questo.|0
ab-234.wav|per molto tempo i benedettini sono soprattutto cluniacensi.|0
ab-235.wav|poi viene il momento in cui nasce un nuovo monastero molto ambizioso.|0
ab-236.wav|che vuole sostituire cluny.|0
ab-237.wav|e diventare il nuovo monastero guida del mondo benedettino è il monastero di sitò, sono i cistercensi.|0
ab-238.wav|che hanno intenzione di sostituire i monaci cluniacensi come ordine di successo.|0
ab-240.wav|non ribadirò mai abbastanza che ordine di successo vuol dire un ordine che attira non soltanto reclute ma donazioni elemosine donazioni anche molto consistenti.|0
ab-241.wav|e quando poi a forza di ricevere donazioni ai monasteri i priorati in tutta europa come hanno i cluniacensi eh bè a quel punto l'abate di cluny diventa uno degli uomini più potenti della cristianità.|0
ab-242.wav|è il suo posto che vorrebbe prendere la batte di sitò.|0
ab-243.wav|e i cistercensi cominciano a studiare come fare per soppiantare i cluniacensi vanno a rileggere la regola benedettina.|0
ab-244.wav|e scoprono che nella regola benedettina.|0
ab-245.wav|non c'è scritto da nessuna parte di che colore deve essere l'abito.|0
ab-246.wav|deve essere una tonaca modesta.|0
ab-247.wav|di stoffa non tinta in colori vistosi ma il colore non è precisato fino a quel momento per consuetudine i monaci benedettini e specialmente cluniacensi vestivano di nero.|0
ab-248.wav|i cistercensi vestiranno di bianco.|0
ab-249.wav|devono essere immediatamente riconoscibili noi siamo diversi.|0
ab-250.wav|e c'è anche come dire una capacità di marketing in questo nel cogliere la capacità del pubblico.|0
